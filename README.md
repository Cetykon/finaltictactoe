The main grid displays a 3x3 layout for a standard Tic Tac Toe game.  
- Player One is assigned the letter **A**, while Player Two uses the letter **B**.  
- Players take turns placing their letters into the grid.  
- A player wins whenever they successfully place three letters in a row: diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.  
- When a player wins, a message pops up announcing which player has won the game.  
- If no player wins by the 9th move, the game declares a draw.  

### Additional Game Features  
1. **Player's Turn Label**: Displays which playerâ€™s turn it is.  
2. **History Data Grid**: Keeps track of all moves made. Players can "teleport" back to a previous move or move forward if the game has not progressed from the selected point.  
3. **Reset Button**: Allows players to easily erase the game history and reset the game.
